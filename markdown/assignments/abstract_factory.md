# Assignment: ASCII art user interfaces

**Goal:**

The goal is to implement a simple ASCII art-based user interface element creation factory using the Abstract Factory design pattern in Java.

**Requirements:**

*Under construction. Please wait a few minutes.*



**Guidelines:**

1. Use simple ASCII art for representation, such as outlining the boundaries of a button or text field.
2. Utilize an abstract factory class and its concrete implementations to ensure consistent creation of different user interface elements.
3. Focus on the principles of the Abstract Factory design pattern without excessive decoration.

Finally, add the ability to dynamically change the content of user interface elements by implementing a `setText` method in the `UIElement` class and providing the implementation in each concrete user interface element class.
